# MultiscrollChuaCircuit
This project implements a Multiscroll Chua Circuit, a type of chaotic circuit that generates multiple scroll attractors. The circuit is based on Chua's circuit, known for its simple yet complex chaotic behavior. This implementation can be used to study nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory. The project includes a circuit schematic, simulation files, and code for generating multiscroll attractors.
